    API view for providing playlist recommendations and suggestions.
    
    Delivers curated playlist suggestions to users for content discovery.
    Currently implements random sampling of public playlists with plans
    for sophisticated recommendation algorithms based on user behavior,
    preferences, and social patterns.

                ...
            ]
        }
    
    Current Algorithm:
        - Filters only public playlists for privacy protection
        - Randomly samples up to 5 playlists for diversity
        - Returns full playlist data including song lists
        - Handles empty playlist collections gracefully
    
    Planned Enhancements:
        - User-based collaborative filtering
        - Content similarity analysis
        - Trending playlist identification
        - Genre and mood-based recommendations
        - Social influence from followed users
        - Personalization based on listening history
    
    Performance Considerations:
        - Limited result set (5 playlists) for fast response
        - Public playlist filtering at database level
        - Efficient random sampling for large datasets
        - Full playlist serialization for immediate use
    
    Privacy Features:
        - Only recommends public playlists
        - No personal data exposure in recommendations
        - Anonymous usage analytics support
    
    Permissions:
        - AllowAny: Public access for all users including guests
    
    Error Handling:
        - Graceful handling of empty playlist collections
        - Clear error messages for no available content
        - Fallback responses for edge cases
