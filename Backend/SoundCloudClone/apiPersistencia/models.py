"""
Data models for music content persistence in the SoundCloud clone.

This module defines the core data models for managing music content including
albums, songs, playlists, and user interactions. The models are designed to
support a comprehensive music streaming platform with social features.

Models:
    Album: Represents music albums with metadata and user association
    Cancion: Represents individual songs with media files and statistics
    Playlist: Represents user-created playlists with privacy settings
    PlaylistCancion: Many-to-many relationship between playlists and songs
    Interaccion: Tracks user interactions (likes, reposts, follows)

Features:
    - Hierarchical content organization (albums â†’ songs)
    - User-generated playlists with custom ordering
    - Social interactions tracking with engagement metrics
    - Flexible content management with optional associations
    - Comprehensive metadata support for rich content display

Database Design:
    - Normalized structure with proper foreign key relationships
    - Integer user IDs for flexible user model integration
    - Automatic timestamp tracking for audit trails
    - Unique constraints to prevent duplicate interactions
    - Optimized indexing through ordering specifications
